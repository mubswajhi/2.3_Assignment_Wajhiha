*** strategy to organisational opportunities and threats resulting from the emerging technologies and practices**

1. The strategy to implement the smart way working in the agriculture industries using the emerging technologies like IOT, AI and Robotics. 

2. The adoption of these technologies in agriculture is proven to be a key driver in the  for expanding  a greater value than the consumer capacity to understand the oppotunities with the great profit. 

3. The agriculture sector is likely to continue to increase it's resilance on new rechnologies over the short to medium term.

# Threats Resulting from above emerging technologies 
1. On cyber crime, despite concerns about the growing scale, economic and societal costs, and other risks of online criminal activity, states have not been able to (and likely will not) agree on a common framework for dealing with cyber crime or other malicious online activity that imperils users and hampers economic growth and development. This state of affairs is unlikely to change, given that some states continue to insist on the need for a common framework.

2. There are other challenges too. Progress remains slow in terms of achieving public and private sector commitments to bridge existing technological divides and move the digital transformation agenda forward.

3. The  further challenge modalities of internet governance, particularly states that view greater state involvement in internet governance as crucial to national security.

4. Nonprofits and multi stake holder initiatives is a number of initiatives involving leading scientists, technologists, researchers, agricultural society organizations, and investors in the fields of AI and robotics are promoting important principles to help mitigate risks and spread the benefits of AI.

5. Emerging technologies can help primary producers to meet, or even benefit from, the rapidly changing desires and needs of our growing population, as well as cope with the macro trends impacting natural resources and supply chains.

*** Develop a strategy to respond to potential impacts on current organisational technologies and practices resulting from the emerging technologies and practices.**

1. RegenTech or organization can help the farmer and encourages them to work in a smater way in there lands.

2. The RegenTech is using the helicopters now  to take the photographs but instead of the helicopters the organization can use the AI drones to see how the land look alike and also helps to take the photographs with the technology without wasting the time on the roads or travelling.

3. The organization was not able to decide how the farmers  can make the better decision for gathering, analyzing and presenting information about their operations and the organiztion collects all the information manually but now with the help of the remote sensors, satellites and and UAV to gather the information in just 24 hours per day  to estimate the weather, analyzing informations.

4. These technologies also help the organization to increase the profit as compare to before for example if the organization is before  gaining the profit of 10% using these emerging technology make an impact for gaining the profit of 25% with these emerging technology in agriculture.

*** Develop a strategy to include objectives of the organisation in responding to the emerging technology or practice**

1. The objective is to change the old way of doing work in agriculture when its a smarter ways of doing the work in the industry and in the organizations too.

2. The objective is to provide the zoom classess for the farmers which takes 5-10 weeks

3. To give the better understanding of these emerging  technologies to the farmers which is necessary for them to learn and how to use them.

*** Develop a strategy to implement changes required in order to achieve intended objectives of the organisation**

1. To achieve the intended objective we requires to give the farmers some training courses how to use these technologies.

2. To achieve the objective we can use zoom platform which cost us less when compare to another platforms.

3. Over the Zoom we can create the meetings and gives the farmers appropriate knowledge how to use these technologies in there farms over the course.If they face difficulty after the course we can provide the farmers recorded videos of the course for there better understanding.

4. We can gain the lots of clients and increase our profit if we uses these technologies.

## Updates in the implementation:

The plan or objective  is to make how these technologies is going to implement in the next 5years in the RegenTech with the following 4 steps:

***Step 1**

# Zoon Courses:

Giving  the course in the emerging technologies which will approx takes the time to complete and give an idea to the farmer how to use it it will take 5-10 weeks and the cost of giving this courses will be $149.90 in which we can host upto 100 participantsin a single sessions with unlimited group meetings and also we can able to stream in the social media channels too.

***Step 2**

1. AI:

If we implement this technology we can able to use for the future to improve the use of sensors or drones in the agriculture 

Complexity: 

All main tasks are based on tree detection and tree classification.

Data needed:

Drone or satellite photos of forest or tree-planting areas. Some technologies use sensors in different forest locations.

Influence on business: 

These technologies help keep track of forest or tree plantation well-being and prevent possible disasters. Aerial images, in particular, are very effective in detecting deforestation. 

Benefits:

* As with other cases, AI helps in covering large areas of land much more effectively. However, this time, portions of land are more challenging to get to. Even more so it can cover some places where checking from the ground is almost impossible.
* AI can check the development of young or recently planted areas of trees, detecting if they need additional irrigation or care. Ensuring that the young trees get all they require will determine how well and fast they will develop.
* A powerful use case is the detection of areas where forest fires are likely to start. For example, these can be some dried-out patches or areas with dangerous concentrations of peatlands.
* With AI, it is possible to classify each tree species quickly. Knowing what species grow in specific areas can be highly beneficial for the land caretakers, but AI can even produce a map with every tree.
* AI can also help determine which trees are best for timber harvesting with minimal environmental impact.
* With installed sensors or regular drone checks, it is possible to quickly identify illegal wood cutting and put a stop to it. There are known cases of using sound recognition to detect chainsaws from distances of kilometers.

Price: 

The price is usually moderate as the main effort would go into high-quality cameras and drones as the algorithms typically need to detect individual trees. The cost is also depends upon the accessories the farmers need it the roughly figure for the drone is $50,000

Examples: 

Both commercial and forestry organizations around the world already use AI. One of the most well-known cases in the aforementioned usage of AI is in Finland. Automatization of forest inspections helped decrease the fieldwork, increasing the effectiveness. Other cases also focus on tree care and accounting, tree crown, or yield estimation.

Years:

In the next 1 year we can use this technology  in the RegenTech to implement our plan for the farmers to use the drones in there farms the usage of this technology is 25%-30%. If the feedback is negative we will use the below steps to implement in the RegenTech.


***Step 3**

2. Farm Automation:

If we implement this technology we can able to use for the future to improve the use of farm automation in the agriculture 

Complexity: 

Is developing in line with robotics, so expertise in both fields is a must.

Data needed: 

Images of the product that needs to be harvested as well as a plant itself in both ripe and growing forms to distinguish which products to gather.

Influence on RegenTech: 

Addresses the labor shortages. It is one of the biggest challenges predicted to arise in the agricultural industry. In addition to removing the unpopular labor-consuming work, it can strengthen food supply chains.

Benefits:

* In many cases, such robotic systems are faster than human workers, substituting many of them.
* Systems work with constant accuracy, diminishing the damage to harvested products.
* They are not susceptible to biological or health threats, which are very sensitive to the food industry. This became a hot topic because of the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the challenges that arose is the possibility that some of the workers could get infected and stall some operations. An even bigger issue was that some workers could not harvest due to quarantine restrictions, leaving the industry critically understaffed.
* In the labor-requiring areas, robotic automation can increase harvest efficiency. A good example is apple harvesting. Since AI has many sensors, it can have a wider angle of view on the plant and spot some fruits that would otherwise go unnoticed.

Price: 

The high cost and complexity of such technologies were among the main challenges for its development. However, this changed with the rise of indoor farming and the pandemic. The  price to install the farm automatiion is ranged between %50,000-$80,000 which is depends upon how many equippments are used tp install.

Examples: 

Most of the developed examples so far are for indoor farming plants. Finding the ripe fruits ready for further operations is one of the usual automation steps. Popular plants to harvest with AI include tomatoes, pepper, strawberries, and other low-growing products. Some of the developments also exist for tree-growing fruits, with apples being the most popular one. The applications are expected to grow massively soon.

Years:

In the next 2 years we can use this technology as the further plan in the RegenTech to implement if the above plan is failed or get the negative feedback from the farmers we will use this technology and  the usage of this technology is 40%-50%.

*** Step 4**

3. IOT: 

If we implement this technology we can able to use the technology for the future to improve the use of livestocks in the agriculture.

Complexity: 

The complexity is in the diversity of the problem. It often works with animal behavior analysis and needs to understand how animals interact with the environment.

Data needed: 

Recordings of the previous animal behavior, usually in video or image format. For other applications like optimizing the feeding schedule, models use historical data.

Influence on RegenTech:

Allows farmers to understand their animals better, even when they do not observe them. It also helps customize the care to cover every animal’s needs, which is almost impossible otherwise. Better conditions for every individual animal result in better output.

Benefits:

* With the ability to uniquely identify every animal, AI learns its behavioral patterns and can determine when they are not behaving in a typical manner. It allows farmers to identify diseases or possible non-optimal conditions quickly.
Algorithms can also determine how much each selected animal needs to eat or which food results in better product quality. It also allows reducing the food waste or the number of unhealthy animals.

* In areas where animals are kept indoors, AI allows for fine-tuning  the conditions just right. For example, setting the optimal weather conditions in the chicken industry can improve productivity. Similarly, the cows can practically decide for themselves when they needto be milked.

* In general, the goal of many AI livestock management projects is animal well-being and disease control. It helps keepers to build ethical farming businesses.

Price: 

Increases with the need to install sensors in the farm equipment. But in cases like behavior analysis, cameras and animal tagging may be enough. For some cases, such as AI for cow farms, sensors are required in many equipment parts. Generally standard cost will range fron $10,000- $50,000 approx installing the livestocks or sensors.

Examples: 

Some animal farms already implemented AI in their operations and report impressive results. In several cases, the production results show up to a 30% increase. Other applications focus on livestock health, allowing to monitor it with a simple camera. Implementations for several kinds of animals already exist.

Years:

If the above plan is failed after using the 2 years or get the negative feedback from the farmers. We wll be use this technology as the following 2 years backup plan in the RegenTech to implement and the usage of this technology is 75%.

*** Develop a strategy that includes considerations for how to implement the changes required to respond to emerging technologies and practices**

1. No regrets: 

Low-cost actions that build resilience, regardless of the scale of the problem. These actions are designed to support government agencies, industry and farmers in responding to the challenges and opportunities presented by the organization in the emerging technologies.

2. Responsive support: 

Responsive support for market resilience. Responsive support involves few costs unless a disruption occurs. In a emerging technologies context, examples of disruptions that the organization might need to respond to ‘reactively’ include unwanted tech transfer and a supply disruption to a organization in the emerging technology. 

3. Pre-emptive support:

Early and targeted action where a disruption to a emerging technology is expected to significantly impact the national interest and there is an imperative to anticipate challenges and opportunities rather than respond to them. Managing the impacts of disruption involve upfront and ongoing costs, regardless of whether disruption occurs.

4. On-shoring & restrictions:

Actions that directly regulate economic and social activity and/or divert resources from areas backed by private investment. These actions may seek to establish a sovereign capability for a organization in the emerging technology or to mitigate risks such as unwanted tech transfer. These actions generally incur higher costs because they can distort markets, require upfront and ongoing government investment and impose regulatory burden on the agriculture industry.
