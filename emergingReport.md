# Emerging Technology report

***A section on how you went about discovering sources of information regarding emerging technologies and practices**
 
I discovered about this emerging technology by  researching over the internet and studied the many case study regarding this that how the technology has transformed many of the industries around us when using them. The emerging technology are the technologies whose development, practical applications, or both are still largely unrealized.

Emerging Technologies are generally new but also include older technologies finding new applications. There are often preceived as capable of changing thr status. In other words, an emerging technology can be defined as "a radically novel and relatively fast growing technology characterised by a certain degree of coherence persisting over time and with the potential exert a considerable impact on the socio-economic domain which is observed in terms of the composition of actors, institutions and patterns of interactions among those, along with the associated knowledge production processes.

Researching the above gives me to how I can implement the emerging technology in the RegenTech these study shows me how I can make impact in the  farmers services and make some strategies using the innovative emergong technology in the RegenTech organization.

I have research about the technolgies in the websites "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_technologies" through the pdf of the case study in the agriculture"https://agrifutures.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/18-048.pdf" and you can  also research about these technologies in the different platforms like social medias, industry journals, conferences, blogs or events so on.

***Identify and describe three emerging technologies in the IT industry that are relevant to RegenTech**

In this report , we examine the three emerging technologiesas shown below, that hold potential foir benefits for the farmers in agriculture within the RegenTech. First, the report examines the consumer perceptions. Which product attributes are appealing to today's consumers and which will cause concern or even rejection. we then present insights, derived from consultations with industry experts and developers of emerging technologies, about the impact of consumer perceptions on adoption of emerging technologies. Finally, for each technology, we summarising potential issues and opportunities in relation to consumer perceptions.

The three technologies are:
 
1. IoT(Internet Of things) or Sensors
2. AI(Artificial Intelligence) and Big Data
3. Automation or Robotics

let's discuss in details of these technologies how there are using in the RegenTech to help the services of the farmers.

1. IoT(Internet Of things) or Sensors:

The Internet of Things(IoT) is a network of objects that are connected wirelessly using the sensors and can be transmit information to each other, or wider network, without human intervention. Connected objects include humans, animals, plants and infrastructure. Though sensing data is not new in technology but technology advancements in cost, quality and robustness of sensors and enabling the data analysis and connectivity technologies, have accelerated the potential of the IoT for agriculture.

2. AI(Artificial Intelligence) and Big Data:

The AI and Big Data involve the whole supply chain the opportunity to harness AI and Big Data in agriculture to assist in decission making that improve yields and reduce input costs are real. This is also developing rapidly with the evoloution of other technologies like IoT. The benefit of using this technology is the use of the data , the size of farming operation may impact the ability to harness and use of Big Data whilst new entrants at various stages of the supply chain will potentially have the ability to leverage influence from datasets, animal welfare and environmental are expected to see the long term positive impact in this technology.

3. Automation or Robotics:

The Automation or Robotics is the science and technology of mechanical, movable structures functional under some form of autonomous control. This technology is being utilised with machines that can substitute for humans to increase efficiency or complete the tasks deemed too dangerous or impossible for humans. The use of this technolgy in agriculture is to complete the tasks such as dairy milking, harvesting, spraying and surveying has replaced the need for human labour.


The above technology is relevant to the RegenTech because we are consulting with the farmers. So, we can give the advice to the farmers that they can work in a smart way using the technologies now a days and reduces there time and effort if there are using this technologies to make their life easier for the future.  


***Identify and describe three emerging practices in the IT industry that are relevant to RegenTech**

In Practice the RegenTech installed the IoT devices in the agriculture and encourage the farmer  or give advice to installed the IoT devices in their farms will improve the grower decission making, including the ability to cut cost, improve yields, monitor crops and generally increase situational awareness acrtoss the farmer operation. If we are using the Livestock IoT application which can used to monitor health, well being, reproductive cycle and location of the livestock. There are so many applications and devices from which we can help and advice the farmers to implement it in there farms. The growth rate of 20% increases in the cost of the RegenTech If they gives this advices to the farmers about the technology.

The practice of the AI in the RegenTech is the integration source of data such as weather, market data or benchmarks with the farmers. The AI is an good opportunity for us so we can improve or help  the farmer areas of decission, variable needs of plants and animals, that leads to maximise productivity and yields. We can advices the farmers to utilize this technology in their farms.

Similarly, the practice of this technology is relevant to RegenTech because we are using this technology still in our system which is really useful for farmers now a days. But we have to improve this technology by adapting the changes in this technology regarding the environments, the ability to share the information and knowledge are assissting farmers in making better decissions and the data processed by farm machinery, machine learning is continously improving decission making, as machines learn the characteristics of each paddlock over time and progressively refine information for automated and semi automated farms manage.
