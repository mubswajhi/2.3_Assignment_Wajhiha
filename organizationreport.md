*** strategy to organisational opportunities and threats resulting from the emerging technologies and practices**

1. The strategy to implement the smart way working in the agriculture industries using the emerging technologies like IOT, AI and Robotics. 

2. The adoption of these technologies in agriculture is proven to be a key driver in the  for expanding  a greater value than the consumer capacity to understand the oppotunities with the great profit. 

3. The agriculture sector is likely to continue to increase it's resilance on new rechnologies over the short to medium term.

# Threats Resulting from above emerging technologies 
1. On cyber crime, despite concerns about the growing scale, economic and societal costs, and other risks of online criminal activity, states have not been able to (and likely will not) agree on a common framework for dealing with cyber crime or other malicious online activity that imperils users and hampers economic growth and development. This state of affairs is unlikely to change, given that some states continue to insist on the need for a common framework.

2. There are other challenges too. Progress remains slow in terms of achieving public and private sector commitments to bridge existing technological divides and move the digital transformation agenda forward.

3. The  further challenge modalities of internet governance, particularly states that view greater state involvement in internet governance as crucial to national security.

4. Nonprofits and multi stake holder initiatives is a number of initiatives involving leading scientists, technologists, researchers, agricultural society organizations, and investors in the fields of AI and robotics are promoting important principles to help mitigate risks and spread the benefits of AI.

5. Emerging technologies can help primary producers to meet, or even benefit from, the rapidly changing desires and needs of our growing population, as well as cope with the macro trends impacting natural resources and supply chains.

*** Develop a strategy to respond to potential impacts on current organisational technologies and practices resulting from the emerging technologies and practices.**

1. RegenTech or organization can help the farmer and encourages them to work in a smater way in there lands.

2. The RegenTech is using the helicopters now  to take the photographs but instead of the helicopters the organization can use the AI drones to see how the land look alike and also helps to take the photographs with the technology without wasting the time on the roads or travelling.

3. The organization was not able to decide how the farmers  can make the better decision for gathering, analyzing and presenting information about their operations and the organiztion collects all the information manually but now with the help of the remote sensors, satellites and and UAV to gather the information in just 24 hours per day  to estimate the weather, analyzing informations.

4. These technologies also help the organization to increase the profit as compare to before for example if the organization is before  gaining the profit of 10% using these emerging technology make an impact for gaining the profit of 25% with these emerging technology in agriculture.

*** Develop a strategy to include objectives of the organisation in responding to the emerging technology or practice**

1. The objective is to change the old way of doing work in agriculture when its a smarter ways of doing the work in the industry and in the organizations too.

2. The objective is to provide the zoom classess for the farmers which takes 10-12 weeks

3. To give the better understanding of these emerging  technologies to the farmers which is necessary for them to learn and how to use them.

*** Develop a strategy to implement changes required in order to achieve intended objectives of the organisation**

1. To achieve the intended objective we requires to give the farmers some training courses how to use these technologies.

2. To achieve the objective we can use zoom platform which cost us less when compare to another platforms.

3. Over the Zoom we can create the meetings and gives the farmers appropriate knowledge how to use these technologies in there farms over the course.If they face difficulty after the course we can provide the farmers recorded videos of the course for there better understanding.

4. We can gain the lots of clients and increase our profit if we uses these technologies.

*** Develop a strategy that includes considerations for how to implement the changes required to respond to emerging technologies and practices**

1. No regrets: 

Low-cost actions that build resilience, regardless of the scale of the problem. These actions are designed to support government agencies, industry and farmers in responding to the challenges and opportunities presented by the organization in the emerging technologies.

2. Responsive support: 

Responsive support for market resilience. Responsive support involves few costs unless a disruption occurs. In a emerging technologies context, examples of disruptions that the organization might need to respond to ‘reactively’ include unwanted tech transfer and a supply disruption to a organization in the emerging technology. 

3. Pre-emptive support:

Early and targeted action where a disruption to a emerging technology is expected to significantly impact the national interest and there is an imperative to anticipate challenges and opportunities rather than respond to them. Managing the impacts of disruption involve upfront and ongoing costs, regardless of whether disruption occurs.

4. On-shoring & restrictions:

Actions that directly regulate economic and social activity and/or divert resources from areas backed by private investment. These actions may seek to establish a sovereign capability for a organization in the emerging technology or to mitigate risks such as unwanted tech transfer. These actions generally incur higher costs because they can distort markets, require upfront and ongoing government investment and impose regulatory burden on the agriculture industry.
