***The features and functions of each emerging technology or practice**

The feature of these emerging technologies can help to the farmers in the agriculture industry. like the Traditional livestock industry is a sector that is widely overlooked and underserviced. If we installed the IoT devices which helps the Livestock to  provides much needed renewable, natuaral resources that we rely on everyday.Livestock management has traditionally been known as running the business of poultry farms, dairy farms, cattle ranches, or other livestock-related agribusinesses. Livestock technology can enhance or improve the productivity capacity, welfare, or management of animals and livestock. Sensor and data technologies have huge benefits for the current livestock industry. It can improve the productivity and welfare of livestock by detecting sick animals and intelligently recognizing room for improvement. 

The rise of digital agriculture and its related technologies has help and  opened a wealth of new data opportunities. Remote sensors, satellites, and UAVs can gather information 24 hours per day over an entire field. These can monitor plant health, soil condition, temperature, humidity, etc. The amount of data these sensors can generate is overwhelming, and the significance of the numbers is hidden in the avalanche of that data.

The idea is to allow farmers to gain a better understanding of the situation on the ground through advanced technology (such as remote sensing) that can tell them more about their situation than they can see with the naked eye. And not just more accurately but also more quickly than seeing it walking or driving through the fields.

Farm automation, often associated with “smart farming”, is technology that makes farms more efficient and automates the crop or livestock production cycle. An increasing number of companies are working on robotics innovation to develop drones, autonomous tractors, robotic harvesters, automatic watering, and seeding robots. Although these technologies are fairly new, the industry has seen an increasing number of traditional agriculture companies adopt farm automation into their processes.
New advancements in technologies ranging from robotics and drones to computer vision software have completely transformed modern agriculture. The primary goal of farm automation technology is to cover easier, mundane tasks.  

# Update:

we need to adopt these emerging technologies to remain competitive within both in the farms and global markets. The costs and challenging climatic conditions and changing the demands for food and fibre, are increasingly putting pressure on primary production. However, the widespread implementation of innovation technologies across the industry is increasing.

***How those features and functions could impact RegenTech**

The expanding impact of consumer perceptions can be seen as a negative influence on agricultural production systems, it equally holds potential to create opportunities for the Australian agriculture industry. Emerging technologies can help primary producers to meet, or even benefit from, the rapidly changing desires and needs of our growing population, as well as cope with the macro trends impacting natural resources and supply chains of the RegenTech. 

The above technologies can help the RegenTech to provide the good services to the farmers and government agencies that work with the farmers as The RegenTech is specialize in the sustainable and regenerative management practices in the agriculture industry by employing these technologies RegenTech can give advice to the farmers which they can implement their work in smarter way

# Update

If the RegenTech is using these technologies it can be really positive effect in the agriculture industry as well as to the Regentech where we can increase  our growth rate to 30% in the cost as compare to before.  

The before RegentTech is using the helicopter but now with the help of AI technology they can use the drones to take the photography and how there land is look alike in the future.

The before RegenTech was not able to decide how the farmers  can make the better decision for gathering, analyzing and presenting information about their operations  and also the data is collected manually, requires the staff to spend there time on the roads going from clients farmer to record the weather measurements. Now the RegenTech can  uses the remote sensors, satellites and UAV to gather the information in just 24 hours per day over entire field without spending there times over the roads.

The regenTech also benefit from the  automating traditional farming processes which  are monumental by tackling issues from consumer preferences, labor shortages, and the environmental footprint of farming.


***Any potential legal or regulatory responsibilities**

There are no uniform standards for sensors, so it is difficult to assess the capacity and value of available products. The only good data is accurate data, so sensors must be robust
and reliable. If sensors fail or transmit faulty data, they have the potential to harm business operations

Sensors need to report accurately, consistently and in a timely manner. However they can become unreliable as a result of incorrect settings, dirt and GPS errors. Establishing sensor performance standards would enable users to better compare different products and identify those that are best able to meet their needs.

Robotics and automation technology provides the grower with greater knowledge of their farm state, and the capacity for acting in real-time, their increasing efficiency, reliability and productivity while minimising environmental impact.

The use of autonomous robots on farms raises questions about their legal liability, particularly where they have the potential (or there is a perception of this potential) to cause damage to
people, property or crops. For example, if the robot is involved in the application of pesticides that have the potential to damage the environment.

The European Parliament recently passed a resolution suggesting robots be granted ‘legal status’ so that they could be held accountable for damage they might cause, triggered by the need to clarify liability laws surrounding self-driving cars. In response, members of the European Council strongly cautioned against such a move. They argued that it assumes that robots have the autonomy to make complex choices and make mistakes — an assumption that drastically overestimates their abilities. In the USA the Brookings Institution has suggested that a new federal agency is needed to regulate robots.

The Australian Centre for Field Robotics informed the 2016 Australian Parliamentary Inquiry into Innovation in Agriculture that a lack of coordinated data and safety standards for robotic systems is preventing their incorporation onto the farm.

To ensure the continued development of robotics applications in agriculture, there is a case for greater training development and delivery in coordination with farmers, technology companies, education providers and researchers. While courses that bridge agriculture and technology exist in Australia, practical advances for farmers in advanced technologies like robotics may require more intensive collaborations, driven by farmer-identified needs. An example is provided by the AgTech Innovation Centre in the USA.

There is also a need for farmer-friendly guidance that sets out the risks and liabilities of adopting different robotics products on the farm. The guidance should demystify common concerns with insurance, ethics, standards, data ownership and protection with the aim of addressing both the real and perceived rights and responsibilities of farmers, and sources
of additional legal advice.

Regulatory issues for robotics are highly context-specific. The regulatory issues for autonomous vehicles with pesticide spraying capabilities are very different from those used in milking sheds.
Autonomous robots on farms can be liable for damage to people, property or crops. There is a need for farmerfriendly guidance that addresses common concerns(such as insurance, ethics, liabilities, data ownership and protection) and clarifies the rights and responsibilities of farmers.

What separates AI from other technologies is its ability to act autonomously, however in the event AI machines cause harm to people or the environment, issues of legal liability are a source of concern.
To continue to take reponsibilities of Artificial Intelligence to benefit agriculture, the sector should:
1. maintain the partnership between the ACFR and Hort Innovation to ensure that current research can find its way onto the market
2.  publicise success stories regarding the application of AI in agriculture, to encourage adoption of AI in the sector and to build public confidence in the sector’s ability to use this technology
3. closely monitor current debate on the regulation of AI to ensure that the voice of agriculture is heard in any  move towards black-letter law.

# Update:

The further we give the courses to the farmers for the better understanding of these emerging technology working in a smart way and giving some learning experience to the farmer who are away from the regenTech headquater we will arrange the farmer course through the Zoom platform.

For giving the classes over the Zoom we need to take  permission from the clients to use there personal data for the course according to the Privacy Act 1988 we need to use  clients personal information safe and secured.
